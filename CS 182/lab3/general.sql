1. In ChirpReads, timesRead must be positive. Please give a name to this constraint when you create it. We
recommend that you use the name positive_reads, but you may use another name. (The other constraints donâ€™t
need to have names.)
2. In ChirpUsers, userID and spouseID must not be the same.
3. In ChirpUsers, if joinDate is NULL, then active must also be NULL
