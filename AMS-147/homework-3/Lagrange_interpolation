% Lagrange interpolation.m
% fucntion computs lagrangian interpolant of given data points

% input 
% xi: vector of interpolation nodes
% yi: vector of data points at the interpolation nodes
% x: vector of points at which we want to evaluate the Lagrange polynomial interpolant
function [y] = Lagrange_interpolation (xi, yi, x)
  y =0; % set y 2 0
  n = length(xi); % length of vector 
  vect = ones(n,length(x)).*dataPoint; % array of all ones
  for r=1:n   %loop for 1 up to length of vector xi
    for i=1:n   % another loop up to the length of xi
      if i~=r    % execute code below if i logicalial isnt r.
        vect(r,:)= vect(r,:).*(x-xi(i))/(xi(r)-xi(i));  % forumala 
       end 
    end
     y = y + yi(r)*vect(r,:);   % loop to find the lagrange polynomicals interpolants evaluated at x 
    %whos y; % list varibles in workspace with size and types
   end
   
   % i keep getting weird answers tried to compare with the octave build in function
   % and they gave double ansers but I got the same answers.
