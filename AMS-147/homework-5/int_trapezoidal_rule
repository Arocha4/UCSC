% int_trapezoidal_rule 
% computes the numberical approximation of I(f).
% for n equally spaced subdivivions 

% input fun: function handle representing f(x)
%       a,b: the endpoints of the integration interval
%       n: number of evenly spaved points in the invterval  aka the # of subintervals

% output  I: numerical approximation of the integral
% comments above copied and pasted for other composite numerical approximation funtions 
function [I]=int_trapezoidal_rule(fun,a,b,n) % funtion given to complete 
h = (b-a)/n; % set h to midpoint 
sum = 0.5*(fun(a) +fun(b)); % fuction fiven from class notes,   
                        % summation form n to m  [f(k_n1) + f(x_n) ] * .5
for i = 1 :n-1 % loop 
  sum = sum + fun(a+i*h);
end
I = h*sum;
% this wasnt that hard to complete the function wasnt as complex as others.
