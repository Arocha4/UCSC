%matrix times vector
%computes the product between an n- matrix and a vector 
%input nxn matrix
%output nx1 matrix 
%use two nesteed for loops 1 to compute y
%2 for controls the index v 
% side note size(A) can determine the size


function [y] = matrix times vector(A,x) % function supplied to us by homework
  
y(1) = 0;  
v = 0; % set variable to zero
%loop for the nuber of rows within the matrix
for k = 1:size(A)
%loop for columns, summing the product of the vectors
  for r = 1:size(A)
    v = v+(A(k,r)*x(r));
  end
  y(k) = v;
  v = 0;
end
%Transpose y to make a 1 row vector
