% using the previous function written compute the numberical soluiton to this end
% NSTEPS=1e5 ~100,000
% DT= 1e-3  ~ .001
% IOSTEP=50
% y0=[1; 2; 3]

% input: 
% this function shouldnt need any inputs besides the utilizing the prvious fuction 

% output: 
% funciton should display 2 figures

% first figure should be the graphs of y1(t), y2(t), and y3(t) vesus time in figure 1

% second figure should display the three dimentional plot

    for i = 1:S ; % loop to store data and plot up to snapshots~2001, given in problem
        y1t(i) = y(1,i); % store values of y1(t) to plot

    figure(1); % Create figure window 1
    plot(t, y1t,'g', t, y2t,'b', t, y3t,'k');  % plot time against solutions 
    
    % display the three dimentional plot
    figure(2); % create figure window 2
    plot3(y1t,y2t,y3t);  % plot3 ~ 3-D line plot 
end
% this was a hard assignment to complete I am unsure of the plots becuase I have not compared 
% the plot with any known correct answer just amoung classmates but most have differnt graphs thus
% I am unsure ofthe correctness of AB2. I can only assume I correctly wrote AB2.
